# Getting Started

Hermes is a Rust engine for running WASM components plus a set of WIT-defined host APIs.
This section focuses on practical onboarding: build/run flows, tooling, and where to look next.

## Repo map

* `hermes/`: engine, CLI, runtime extensions, packaging code.
* `wasm/`: WIT interfaces, examples, integration tests, and bindings tooling.
* `hermes/apps/athena/`: reference application modules and manifests.

## Choose a path

* Quick Start: build and run Athena with `just`.
* Development: local vs containerized workflows, module rebuild patterns, CLI usage.
* Advanced: Earthly targets, WIT docs/bindings, runtime flags and environment config.
