# Solution Strategy

<!-- See: https://docs.arc42.org/section-4/ -->

| Goal/Requirement | Solution | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flexible and modular backend engine to run decentralized applications | Event-driven engine on Wasmtime using the WASM Component Model; all host capabilities exposed via WIT | [Hermes Engine](05_building_block_view/hermes_engine.md) |
| WASM application packaging | HDF5-based application containers with strict directory layout, metadata, and immutability | [Packaging Requirements](08_concepts/hermes_packaging_requirements/overview.md#the-full-application-filesystem-hierarchy) |
| Application integrity and trust | COSE signatures over CBOR payloads; certificate store; API version checks | [Signature Payload](08_concepts/hermes_signing_procedure/signature_format.md#signature-payload) |
| HTTP and browser integration | Built-in HTTP gateway serving static assets and routing API requests to modules by endpoint subscriptions and app hostnames | [HTTP Gateway](08_concepts/http_gateway.md) |
| P2P distribution and coordination | Embedded IPFS/libp2p node for pub/sub, DHT, and content addressing; signature validation on topics/messages | [IPFS](08_concepts/ipfs.md) |
| Efficient WASM execution | Pre-linked `InstancePre` per module; immutable module state across calls via explicit runtime context | [Hermes Engine â€” WASM execution](05_building_block_view/hermes_engine.md#wasm-execution-model) |
| Data access and isolation | VFS backed by HDF5 with permissioned directories (`srv`, `usr`, `tmp`, etc.) | [VFS Permissions](08_concepts/vfs.md#permissions) |
| Event routing and concurrency | Global MPSC event queue + thread pool with per-target dispatch; explicit app/module targeting | [Event Model](08_concepts/event_model.md#event-model-and-concurrency) |
| Catalyst (Athena) MVP flows | Topic schema, receipt model, dependency tracking for event processing | [Catalyst MVP](08_concepts/catalyst_mvp.md) |
