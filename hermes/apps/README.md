# Hermes Applications

This directory contains production Hermes applications and their build configuration. These applications demonstrate real-world usage of the Hermes WASM application engine.

## Architecture Overview

Hermes applications are composed of:
- **WASM Modules**: Individual components compiled to WebAssembly (WASI-P2)
- **Application Manifests**: JSON configurations that define how modules are loaded and configured
- **Module Manifests**: Metadata describing individual WASM components
- **Configuration Files**: Runtime settings and schemas for validation

## Available Commands

Use `just` to run the following commands from this directory:

### Build Commands

- **`just build-hermes`** - Build the Hermes binary in release mode
  - Compiles the core Hermes engine located in `../`
  - Output: `../target/release/hermes`
  - Required for packaging and running applications

- **`just build-athena`** - Build and package the Athena HTTP proxy component
  - Generates Rust bindings from WIT interfaces
  - Compiles the HTTP proxy module to WASM using Earthly
  - Packages the module using the Hermes CLI
  - Creates the final application package
  - Output: `athena/app.happ`

### Run Commands

- **`just run-athena`** - Run the Athena application using the release binary
  - Requires prior build (`just build-hermes` and `just build-athena`)
  - Runs with `--untrusted` flag for security isolation
  - Uses the packaged application at `athena/app.happ`

- **`just run-all`** - Build everything and run the Athena application
  - Complete workflow: build → package → run
  - Equivalent to `just build-hermes && just build-athena && just run-athena`

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before building, ensure you have:

1. **Earthly** for containerized builds:
   ```bash
   # Install from https://earthly.dev/get-earthly
   curl -fsSL https://earthly.dev/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Just command runner**:
   ```bash
   # Install via cargo (if you have Rust) or package manager
   cargo install just
   # Or via package manager (Ubuntu/Debian)
   sudo apt install just
   # Or download binary from https://github.com/casey/just/releases
   ```

3. **GitHub Token** (for Earthly builds):
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   ```

**That's it!** No need to install Rust locally - Earthly handles all compilation in containerized environments with pre-configured toolchains.

### Building and Running

1. **🚀 Complete workflow - Build and run everything (START HERE):**
   ```bash
   just build-run-all
   ```
   **This single command does EVERYTHING you need:**
   - Cleans up any previous state (`clean-hfs`)
   - Builds the Hermes engine (`build-hermes`) 
   - Builds and packages the Athena application (`build-athena`)
   - Runs the application (`run-athena`)
   
   **Use this command for your first build and whenever you want a clean, complete rebuild.**

2. **Individual commands (optional - only if you need granular control):**
   ```bash
   # Build just the Hermes engine
   just build-hermes
   
   # Build just the Athena WASM module and package
   just build-athena
   
   # Run Athena (requires prior build)
   just run-athena
   
   # Clean up state files
   just clean-hfs
   ```

### Development Workflow

For most development work, simply use:
```bash
just build-run-all
```

For development, you can build components individually:

## Applications

### Athena - HTTP Proxy Service

A secure HTTP/HTTPS redirect service with configurable validation and routing policies.

**Architecture:**
- **Location**: `athena/`
- **Module Source**: `athena/modules/http-proxy/`
- **Application Manifest**: `athena/manifest_app.json`
- **Module Manifest**: `athena/modules/http-proxy/lib/manifest_module.json`
- **WASM Binary**: `athena/modules/http-proxy/lib/http_proxy.wasm` (generated)
- **Application Package**: `athena/app.happ` (generated)

**Key Features:**
- HTTP request/response handling
- Configurable routing policies
- Security validation
- WASM-based isolation

**Configuration Files:**
- `config.schema.json` - Runtime configuration schema
- `settings.schema.json` - Application settings schema
- `metadata.json` - Application metadata and licensing

**Security:**
- Runs with `--untrusted` flag for maximum isolation
- WASM sandbox provides additional security boundaries
- Configurable validation policies

## Build Process Deep Dive

### 1. Binding Generation
- Generates Rust bindings from WIT (WebAssembly Interface Types)
- Creates `hermes.rs` with all necessary interfaces
- Required before compiling WASM modules

### 2. WASM Compilation
- Compiles Rust code to `wasm32-wasip2` target
- Uses optimized release profile (`opt-level = "z"`, `lto = true`)
- Produces highly optimized WASM binary

### 3. Module Packaging
- Validates module manifest against schema
- Bundles WASM binary with configuration files
- Creates distributable module package

### 4. Application Packaging
- Combines modules into complete application
- Validates application manifest
- Creates final `.happ` (Hermes App Package) file

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build fails with "No Earthfile found":**
- Ensure you're running commands from the `hermes/apps/` directory
- Check that `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is set

**WASM compilation errors:**
- Verify `wasm32-wasip2` target is installed: `rustup target list --installed`
- Check Rust version compatibility

**Permission denied errors:**
- Ensure Earthly daemon is running and accessible
- Check Docker/Podman permissions

**Missing hermes binary:**
- Run `just build-hermes` first
- Check that `../target/release/hermes` exists

### Debug Mode

For debugging builds, you can run Earthly commands directly:

```bash
cd athena/modules
earthly +gen-bindings --no-cache
earthly +build-http-proxy --no-cache
```
