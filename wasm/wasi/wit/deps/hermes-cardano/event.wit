/// # Cardano API
///
/// Events triggered by subscribing to blockchain updates.
///
/// ## Event Scheduling
///
/// **Guarantee**: Block events will occur and be fully processed, 
/// before any transaction events from that block are sent.
///
/// **Guarantee**: Transaction events will be sent and could arrive in any order,
/// BUT only after all event processing of the block they come from is complete.
/// Further block or rollback events will not occur until all transaction events
/// from a block are fully processed.
/// 
/// **Guarantee**: Rollback events will be fully processed before the next block 
/// event will be sent.  The block event sent immediately after a rollback event 
/// will be the target of the rollback.  This means that rollback processing does 
/// not need to reset or re-subscribe the blockchain follower.
///
/// **Warning**: Events from different blockchains are not synchronized between 
/// each other.
