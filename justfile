# Hermes Applications Build System
#
# This justfile provides a complete build and deployment workflow for Hermes WASM applications.
# It uses Earthly for containerized builds to ensure consistent, reproducible compilation
# across different development environments.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Earthly (https://earthly.dev/get-earthly) - Containerized build system
#   - Docker or Podman - Container runtime for Earthly
#
# Quick Start:
#   just build-run-all    # Complete workflow: build ‚Üí package ‚Üí run
#
# Development Workflow:
#   just clean-hfs        # Clean up previous state
#   just get-local-hermes # Build the core engine
#   just get-local-athena     # Build & package WASM modules
#   just run-athena       # Run the application
#
# File Formats:
#   .happ - Hermes Application Package (complete application bundle)
#   .hmod - Hermes Module Package (individual WASM component with manifest)
#   .hfs  - Hermes File System state files (runtime cache and temporary data)
#
# Environment Variables:
#   REDIRECT_ALLOWED_HOSTS - Comma-separated allowed redirect hosts (default: app.dev.projectcatalyst.io)
#   REDIRECT_ALLOWED_PATH_PREFIXES - Allowed path prefixes for redirects (default: /api/gateway/v1/config/frontend)

# Build the Hermes binary in release mode using Earthly
#
# This target compiles the core Hermes WASM application engine located in the parent
# directory (../). The engine provides the runtime environment for WASM modules and
# handles HTTP routing, logging, security sandboxing, and module lifecycle management.
#
# Build Process:
#   1. Uses Earthly for containerized compilation (no local Rust toolchain required)
#   2. Compiles with release optimizations (--release flag)
#   3. Outputs binary to ../target/release/hermes
#   4. Makes binary executable and copies to working location
#
# Output: ../target/release/hermes (executable binary)
# Duration: ~2-5 minutes (depending on system and cache state)
# Dependencies: None (self-contained with Earthly)

# Build and package the Athena HTTP proxy WASM component
#
# This target performs the complete build pipeline for the Athena application:
#   1. Generates Rust bindings from WebAssembly Interface Types (WIT)
#   2. Compiles HTTP proxy module to WASM using wasm32-wasip2 target

#   4. Creates the final application package (.happ file)
#
# Build Pipeline:

#
# Components Built:
#   - HTTP Proxy Module: athena/modules/http-proxy/ (Rust ‚Üí WASM)

#
# Output Files:
#   - athena/modules/http-proxy/lib/http_proxy.wasm (WASM binary)

# Run the Athena application using the Hermes runtime

# Executes the packaged Athena application in the Hermes WASM runtime environment.

# Runtime Configuration:
#   - Security: --untrusted flag enables maximum sandboxing

# Complete build and run workflow - recommended for most use cases
#
# This is the primary command for development and demonstration. It performs
# the complete workflow from clean state to running application:
#
# Workflow Steps:
#   1. clean-hfs      - Clear previous application state
#   2. get-local-hermes  - Compile the Hermes runtime engine
#   3. get-local-athena   - Build and package WASM modules
#   4. run-athena     - Launch the application
#
# When to use:
#   ‚úÖ First-time setup and builds
#   ‚úÖ Clean rebuilds after significant changes
#   ‚úÖ Demonstration and testing scenarios
#   ‚úÖ When unsure about current build state
#
# Duration: ~5-12 minutes total (depending on system and cache state)
#
# Alternative for incremental development:
#   If only changing WASM module code: just get-local-athena && just run-athena
#   If only changing engine code: just get-local-hermes && just run-athena
#
# Environment Variables: Same as run-athena (see above)
# Example with custom config: REDIRECT_ALLOWED_HOSTS=example.com just build-run-all

# Development helper: Quick rebuild of just the WASM components
#
# Use this when you're iterating on the HTTP proxy module code and don't need
# to rebuild the entire Hermes engine. Faster than build-run-all for development.
#
# Workflow: Build WASM ‚Üí Package ‚Üí Run
# Duration: ~3-5 minutes (skips Hermes engine compilation)
# When to use: Iterating on athena/modules/http-proxy/src/ changes
dev-athena: get-local-athena run-athena
